## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories
    - #### As a user I want to find coffee suppliers, so that I can stock up my coffee shop.
    - #### As a user I want to know where the coffee comes from and what makes it so special, so that I can build prestige/popularity on the quality of the product.
    - #### As a user I want to know how the coffee is produced, so that I know if the product is suitable for my needs and what my customers want.
    - #### As a user, I want to know what the minimum order is, so that I can later decide if I need to increase my supply and how that will affect the costs.
    - #### As a user, I want to know how the coffee is packaged and shipped, so that I am informed on the product standards.
    - #### As a user I want to be able to make an inquiry based on my needs, so that I can maybe start a business relationship.
    
-   ### The five elements of user experience
    - #### The **strategy** plane. For the users, the site will provide information on the Colombian coffee supplier located in Antioquia, why this coffee is the best choice for their shop, how the coffee beans are harvested and processed, and the possibility of inquiring more to initiate a business relationship. For the company, the site will provide exposure to direct clients, eliminating wholesaler costs and as a result offering competitive pricing models.
    - #### The **scope** plane. Features to be included: users can fill in a form to send an email inquiring for more information, a collapsible FAQ section, scrollspy navigation, API Google Maps location. As for the content, the following will be displayed: powerful slogan and company GPS coordinates, information on key features of the high quality coffee beans, what the production process looks like, frequently asked questions that align with the relevant user stories and provide more additional information, and contact details.
    - #### The **structure** plane. The website is structured into five different sections and a linked contact form. The first section or "Home" consists of five elements: the logo on the upper left corner, a slogan in the center of the viewport, a "Let's do business" button linking to the contact form right below the slogan and the GPS coordinates of the coffee plantations in Colombia, right in the tropics. In the background of this first section, there will be an image slidehow playing. The second section called "The Coffee" consists of two elements coming together on the screen with a fade in effect: an image and a card detailing the key features of the coffee beans. The third section called "The Making" consists of the five steps of collecting the coffee beans, explaining the process behind those. This third section will appear on scroll. The fourth section called "FAQ" consists of five questions about important information for potential clients. These are aimed to answer the user stories and will be displayed in an accordion layout. The fifth and last part, also called "Contact", will include the "Let's do business" button linked to the form, the logo, address and a map showing the pinned coordinates from the first section. I decided not to include any social media links, as the company is new on the market and it's just getting started with their online presence. At the bottom of the page, there is a fixed navigation menu that is transformed into a hamburger menu on mobile. The website is designed to be kept simple and minimalistic, with an intuitive and informative approach, always keeping a visual balanced style for coherence. 
    - #### The **skeleton** plane

    - #### The **surface** plane. For the font, I have chosen Barlow Google font with a Sans Serif fallback. Favicon will be added and based on the logo to create cohesion and visual reassurance for the users. The website's basic color scheme can be checked [here](assets/docs/colors-palette.pdf).
