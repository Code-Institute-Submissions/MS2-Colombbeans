## Testing

### Code Validators 

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input): no errors found. The validator returns some warnings which, after some quick research, I learned could be safely ignored.

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input): no errors found. The validator returns some "unknown vendor extension" warnings which, after some quick research, I learned could be safely ignored.

- [JShint](https://jshint.com/): no errors found. The validator returns a couple of warnings which, after some quick research, I learned could be safely ignored.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### As a user I want to find coffee suppliers, so that I can stock up my coffee shop.
    - The website is optimized for SEO search through meta keywords that help users land on my page. 
    - The title of the website is a descriptive wordplay (Colombia and beans), which presents users with a clear expectation of the product.
- #### As a user I want to know where the coffee comes from and what makes it so special, so that I can build prestige/popularity on the quality of the product.
    - The banner type header on the landing page informs users that the coffee is high quality and produced in Colombia.
    - In the second section (the coffee), the key characteristics of the beans are enumerated: Arabica beans ranking as the most superior from all varieties, rich and unique flavors (underlying tones of nutty, chocolaty or fruity aromas).
    - In the third section (the process), it is described how the beans are carefully hand-picked in a traditional way that allows only for the finest quality.
    - In the fourth section (FAQ), the first and fourth questions describe coffee characteristics that directly explain why Colombbeans is so special and how important fair trade is.

    - In the second section, on the back of the images, it is specified which flavors suit the different types of roasts best, so the user can decide based on their specific needs/demand.
    - In the third section, the entire coffee production process is described, so the user can decide if they are interested in a more traditionally produced coffee, depending on their needs/demand.
    - In the fourth section, the final statement encourages users to get in touch, so Colombbeans team can better understand their needs and cater to that, becoming an extension of their business.
- #### As a user, I want to know what the minimum order is, so that I can later decide if I need to increase my supply and how that will affect the costs.
    - In the fourth section, specifically in the last FAQ box, this is answered. Additionally, users are encouraged to get in touch with Colombbeas for discussing their unique needs on a case by case basis. 
- #### As a user, I want to know how the coffee is packaged and shipped, so that I am informed on the product standards.
    - In the third section, it is explained that the beans are sorted by quality and size to later be packed in bags and exported in the shortest of times, to ensure the fresh aroma.
    - In the fourth section, second FAQ, it is specified that regardless of location, delivery times only take up to three days maximum.
